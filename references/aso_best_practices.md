# ASO Best Practices

## Apple App Store Ranking Factors

### Primary Factors (High Impact)

1. **App Name/Title**
   - Most important ranking factor
   - Include primary keyword naturally
   - 30 character limit - use them all wisely
   - Brand name + keyword phrase works best

2. **Keywords Field**
   - 100 character limit
   - Comma-separated, no spaces
   - Don't repeat title/subtitle words
   - Include singular AND plural forms
   - Research competitors' keywords

3. **Subtitle**
   - 30 character limit
   - Secondary ranking factor
   - Focus on conversion, not just keywords
   - Describe key benefit clearly

4. **Downloads & Velocity**
   - Total download count matters
   - Download velocity (recent trend) crucial
   - First 48 hours after launch are critical
   - Consistent growth better than spikes

5. **Ratings & Reviews**
   - Average rating (4.0+ preferred)
   - Review volume (more = better)
   - Review velocity (recent reviews weighted higher)
   - Respond to reviews (shows engagement)

### Secondary Factors (Medium Impact)

6. **App Updates**
   - Regular updates signal active development
   - "What's New" text indexed for search
   - Bug fix releases count too

7. **In-App Purchase (IAP) Titles**
   - IAP names are searchable
   - Optimize subscription/feature names

8. **Developer Name**
   - Slight ranking impact
   - Build brand recognition over time

9. **Category Ranking**
   - Top charts drive organic discovery
   - Category placement affects visibility

### Engagement Factors (Lower Impact but Important)

10. **Retention Rate**
    - Users who keep the app installed
    - Session length and frequency
    - Signals quality to App Store algorithm

11. **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**
    - Impressions to page views
    - Affected by icon, title, screenshots

12. **Conversion Rate**
    - Page views to downloads
    - Critical for paid acquisition efficiency

## Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Tips

### App Icon
- Simple, recognizable design
- Test on dark and light backgrounds
- Stand out in search results
- Consistent with app design
- Avoid text in icon (too small to read)

### Screenshots

**Screenshot Order Strategy:**
1. Screenshot 1: Value proposition + emotional hook
2. Screenshot 2-3: Core features
3. Screenshot 4: Social proof/results
4. Screenshot 5: Additional features/benefits

**Design Best Practices:**
- Use text overlays (short, punchy)
- Show real UI (not just lifestyle)
- Include device frame if helpful
- Maintain consistent branding
- Localize for each market
- Portrait orientation preferred

**Text Guidelines:**
- Headline: 3-5 words max
- Subheadline: 5-8 words max
- High contrast for readability
- Font size: readable at thumbnail

### App Preview Video (Optional)
- 15-30 seconds optimal
- Show first-time user experience
- No hands/device in frame
- 80% app footage minimum
- Poster frame carefully chosen
- Multiple device sizes required

### Description Optimization

**Structure:**
```
Paragraph 1: Hook - key value proposition
Paragraph 2: Key features (bullet points)
Paragraph 3: Social proof/testimonials
Paragraph 4: Call to action
```

**First 3 Lines Rule:**
- Most users don't expand description
- Critical information first
- Include primary keywords naturally

**Formatting:**
- Use markdown (bold, bullets)
- Short paragraphs
- Emojis sparingly
- Line breaks for scannability

### Ratings Strategy

**When to Ask:**
- After positive in-app experience
- After completing key action
- Not during onboarding
- Not after errors/crashes

**How to Ask:**
- Use native SKStoreReviewController
- Don't interrupt user flow
- Limit frequency (Apple enforces anyway)
- Provide feedback alternative for negative

## A/B Testing Strategies
